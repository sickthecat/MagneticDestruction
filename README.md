'securely' erase a hard drive. Might actually kill an SSD, which depending on how you feel about the the glowies... Might not be a bad thing.
Get the clicky-clack for those 4:22 AM wake up calls.
Follow this up with a Powe Drill and a Sawzall.  Maybe.
make sure you install `shred`
If you ruin your hardware with this, it's not my fuckin' fault.
